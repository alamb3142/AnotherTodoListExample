## About

Yet another todo list example app. The goal of this project is for me to play around with some cool technologies, design patterns, libraries, etc.

The app itself is made up of an Angular frontend communicating to a .NET 7 gRPC API via [Grpc-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web). The backend will be supported by SQL Server, with schemas generated by EF Core using it's Fluent API for configuration.

This approach should provide the following benefits:

- Code first EF allows our domain model classes to act as the source of truth for our persistence model, allowing easier refactoring of the model.
- The use of Grpc allows for contract first API development that can be easily enforced on the frontend using ngx-grpc & protoc for client side code generation.

## Backend

TodoList.Service is a .NET GRPC API built on the following principles:
* Contract first development with Grpc
* CQRS with [Mediator](https://github.com/martinothamar/Mediator)
* [FluentResults](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults) & no exceptions for control flow
* Code first database with EF Core, using fluent api for config
* Some form of FluentValidator package (TBD)

Some things that might change going forward:
* GRPC
    * Pros: better performance & easy client generation
    * Cons: with CQRS pattern we already have a data contract, the commands and queries, keeping the protos & grpc code in sync with that feels like unnecessary complexity, a thin http API layer would be much easier to manage & refactor
* Mediator
    * I like the pattern but I don't know if the library is just adding magic to a pattern that's fairly simple to implement manually & provide more visibility. That being said, I haven't really explorered the pipeline behaviours yet & I will still use the library for event handlers & notification contracts
